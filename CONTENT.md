# ACKU-AI Masterclass: Practical AI for Manufacturing & Supply Chain Leaders

## Program Overview

**Audience:** C-suite, VPs, and Directors in manufacturing, supply chain, quality, and operations
**Total Duration:** 5.5 hours across 4 modules (can be delivered in one full day or two half-days)
**Facilitator Positioning:** Practitioner, not theorist. Someone who built this inside a regulated, global manufacturing operation. Not selling software. Selling clarity.

**Core Promise:** By the end of this masterclass, you will know exactly where your organization stands on AI maturity, have a prioritized roadmap of use cases, understand what implementation actually requires, and have a governance framework you can deploy Monday morning.

## MODULE 1: "Where Are You Now?" (90 minutes)

### Opening (10 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Welcome. Before we talk about AI strategy, AI tools, AI anything, I want to start with a question that most consultants skip: Where are you, honestly, right now?

Not where your board thinks you are. Not where your last conference panel said you should be. Where you actually are.

I spent over a decade inside a major consumer goods company. Global manufacturing. FDA-regulated. Tens of thousands of employees. When I started leading AI transformation there, I had to answer this same question. And the honest answer was: we were further behind than anyone wanted to admit.

That honesty is where real progress starts.

**Story/Anecdote:**

Tell the "conference delusion" story: I was at an industry conference, and every panel had someone talking about their AI transformation. Incredible demos. Beautiful slides. Then I'd talk to them at the bar afterward and ask, "So how many people in your org are actually using these tools day to day?" Long pause. "Well, we're still in pilot phase." Every time. The gap between what companies present externally and what's happening internally is massive. I call it AI Theater.

**Audience Interaction:**

Quick anonymous poll (use Mentimeter or similar): "How would you rate your organization's AI maturity on a scale of 1-5?" Display results live. Guarantee: most of the room will cluster at 2-3. Then explain why even that's probably generous.

### The AI Maturity Model (20 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Let's put language around this. Five levels:

**Level 1: Unaware**
- AI is something other companies do
- No formal discussion at leadership level
- Data infrastructure is fragmented or nonexistent
- "We have bigger priorities right now"

**Level 2: Experimenting**
- A few enthusiasts are playing with tools
- Maybe one or two pilots running
- No coordination, no governance, no budget line
- Leadership is "interested" but not committed
- This is where 60-70% of manufacturing companies actually sit

**Level 3: Implementing**
- Dedicated budget and at least one full-time person on AI
- Multiple use cases in production (not just pilot)
- Some governance structure exists
- Cross-functional awareness is growing
- Maybe 15-20% of companies are genuinely here

**Level 4: Scaling**
- AI is part of how the business operates, not a side project
- Hundreds of users across multiple functions
- Governance is mature, Legal and Compliance are integrated
- Measurable business impact tracked and reported
- Less than 5% of manufacturing companies

**Level 5: Transforming**
- AI fundamentally changes how the business competes
- Decision-making is AI-augmented at every level
- Culture has shifted: people expect AI tools
- Continuous learning and improvement cycles
- Almost nobody is here yet, and that's fine

**Data Points to Cite:**
- McKinsey 2024: Only 11% of companies report significant financial impact from AI
- Gartner: 85% of AI projects fail to deliver intended value
- BCG: Companies that focus on deployment (not just development) see 3x the return

**Story/Anecdote:**

When I started the AI program at my company, I thought we were a Level 2. Honestly, we were barely a Level 1 in most functions. The data science team had some models running, but almost nobody in operations knew about them. The models weren't solving problems people actually had. They were solving problems data scientists found interesting. That's a big difference.

---

### The AI Theater Problem (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

AI Theater is when your organization looks like it's doing AI, but nothing is actually changing how work gets done.

Signs you're doing AI Theater:
- You have a "Center of Excellence" that produces slide decks but not deployed tools
- Your AI demos wow the board but nobody on the floor has ever seen them
- You hired data scientists who spend 80% of their time cleaning data and 20% building models that never get used
- Your AI strategy document is 40 pages long and six months old
- You can name your AI initiatives but not your AI users

The root cause is usually the same: organizations start with technology and work backward to problems. "We have this cool ML model, now let's find a use for it." That's backwards. Start with the pain point. Start with the person who's spending four hours a day on something that could take twenty minutes.

**Story/Anecdote:**

I watched a demo once, beautiful predictive maintenance model. Six months of development. The plant manager watched, nodded, said "That's great." Never used it. Why? Because the model predicted failures 48 hours out, but their maintenance scheduling worked on weekly cycles. The tool didn't fit the workflow. Nobody asked the plant manager what he actually needed before building it. That's AI Theater. Great performance, empty seats.

**Data Points to Cite:**
- MIT Sloan: 70% of companies report minimal or no impact from AI
- VentureBeat: 87% of data science projects never make it to production
- Harvard Business Review: The #1 reason AI projects fail is lack of alignment with business processes

---

### Self-Assessment Framework (20 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Now let's get specific about YOUR organization. I'm going to walk you through a framework with honest questions. Not the questions your board asks. The questions that actually reveal where you stand.

**Category 1: Data Readiness**
- Can you access your manufacturing data in one place, or is it in 15 different systems?
- When was the last time someone audited your data quality?
- Do your operators trust the data in your systems?
- How long does it take to get a cross-functional data set for analysis?

**Category 2: Talent & Culture**
- If you announced an AI training program tomorrow, what percentage of your workforce would sign up voluntarily?
- Do your frontline managers see AI as a threat or a tool?
- How many people in your org could explain what a large language model does in plain English?
- When someone suggests a new technology, is the default response curiosity or resistance?

**Category 3: Governance & Infrastructure**
- Does your Legal team know what AI tools employees are already using?
- Do you have a policy on AI use? Is it more than two paragraphs?
- If an AI tool made a wrong recommendation that caused a quality issue, do you know who is accountable?
- Can your IT infrastructure support real-time data processing?

**Category 4: Leadership Alignment**
- Can your CEO articulate what AI means for your business in three sentences?
- Is AI a line item in your budget or buried in IT's discretionary spending?
- When was the last time AI came up in a board meeting, and was it substance or theater?

**Audience Interaction:**

Hand out or display the self-assessment scorecard. Give participants 5 minutes to score themselves honestly. Then ask: "Who scored themselves lower than they expected?" Usually, most hands go up. That's the point.

---

### Quick Wins vs Strategic Bets Matrix (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Not everything needs to be a moonshot. In fact, the fastest way to kill an AI program is to start with something too ambitious.

Draw a 2x2 matrix:
- X-axis: Implementation effort (Low → High)
- Y-axis: Business impact (Low → High)

**Quick Wins (Low effort, Moderate-High impact):** Start here.
- Document summarization and search
- Meeting note automation
- Standard report generation
- Email drafting and response templates
- Quality data trend analysis

**Strategic Bets (High effort, High impact):** Plan for these, but don't start here.
- Predictive quality (reducing defects before they happen)
- Demand forecasting with AI augmentation
- Automated regulatory document generation
- Supply chain risk prediction
- Digital twins for manufacturing optimization

**Avoid (High effort, Low impact):**
- Building custom models when off-the-shelf works
- AI for AI's sake ("blockchain for supply chain" energy)
- Trying to replace human judgment in regulated decisions

**Time Fillers (Low effort, Low impact):**
- Fine for learning, but don't call them strategy

**Story/Anecdote:**

Our first real wins weren't glamorous. We got people using AI to summarize long regulatory documents. To draft standard operating procedures faster. To analyze complaint trends. None of that makes a keynote. But it saved people hours every week, and those people became evangelists. They told their colleagues. Word spread. Within 18 months, we had over 1,000 people actively using AI tools. Not because I told them to. Because the early adopters told them it actually worked.

**Transition to Module 2:**

So now you know where you are. You've been honest about your maturity level, you've identified some quick wins, and you've seen the difference between AI Theater and real progress. In the next module, we're going to build the strategy that turns awareness into action. But I'll warn you: if the word "strategy" makes you think of a 50-page deck that sits on a shelf, you're going to need to reset your expectations. We're building something you can actually execute. Let's take a 10-minute break.

---

## MODULE 2: "Building Your Strategy" (90 minutes)

### Opening: Why Most AI Strategies Fail (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Welcome back. Let's start with a uncomfortable truth: most AI strategies are dead on arrival. They fail before the first model is built.

Three reasons:

**1. Too Ambitious**
The strategy tries to transform everything at once. "We'll deploy AI across all 12 plants in 18 months." No, you won't. You'll deploy it in one plant, learn 50 things you didn't expect, and spend the next six months adjusting. That's not failure. That's reality.

**2. No Governance**
The strategy talks about use cases and tools but says nothing about risk, compliance, data privacy, or accountability. In regulated manufacturing, this is a dealbreaker. The first time Legal finds out you've been using AI to generate batch records without their sign-off, your program is dead.

**3. Wrong Talent Model**
The strategy assumes you need to hire 20 data scientists. You don't. You need to upskill the people who already know your business. A quality engineer who understands AI is 10x more valuable than a data scientist who doesn't understand GMP.

**Data Points to Cite:**
- Deloitte: 74% of companies find AI implementation more difficult than expected
- Accenture: Organizations that invest in workforce AI training see 2.5x the ROI vs those that only invest in technology
- PwC: Only 25% of AI strategies include governance from the start

**Story/Anecdote:**

I've seen three types of AI strategies in my career. Type one is the "Innovation Theater" deck: 40 beautiful pages, written by a consulting firm, presented to the board, never referenced again. Type two is the "IT Project" plan: everything filtered through the technology lens, no business ownership, dies when the CTO moves on. Type three is the one that works: a living document owned by the business, with clear use cases tied to real pain points, governance built in, and a talent plan that invests in the people you already have. That's what we're building today.

### The ACKU Framework: Learn → Plan → Build → Scale (20 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Our approach has four phases. Each one has to happen before you move to the next. Skip a step, and you'll be back here in 12 months wondering what went wrong.

**LEARN (Weeks 1-4)**
- Assess current state (you just did this in Module 1)
- Interview stakeholders across functions: what are their biggest time sinks? What decisions do they make with incomplete data?
- Catalog existing data assets and infrastructure
- Identify your internal champions, the people who are already experimenting
- Benchmark against industry peers (honest benchmarking, not conference benchmarking)

Key output: A current-state assessment that everyone agrees on. Not aspirational. Factual.

**PLAN (Weeks 5-8)**
- Prioritize use cases using the impact vs feasibility matrix
- Build governance framework (yes, this early, non-negotiable)
- Define success metrics for each use case, business metrics, not model metrics
- Create a talent development plan
- Set realistic timelines (double your first estimate, you'll thank me later)
- Identify budget requirements and build the business case

Key output: A prioritized roadmap with 3-5 use cases, governance guardrails, and a business case your CFO will approve.

**BUILD (Months 3-6)**
- Start with ONE use case. Not three. One.
- Deploy to a pilot group (20-50 people max)
- Focus on change management from day one: training, feedback loops, iteration
- Measure adoption weekly, not just accuracy
- Document everything: what worked, what didn't, what surprised you

Key output: One deployed use case with measurable adoption and business impact data.

**SCALE (Months 6-18)**
- Use pilot data to make the case for expansion
- Roll out to additional functions and sites
- Formalize training programs
- Mature governance as you grow
- Add use cases based on demand, not ambition

Key output: A self-sustaining AI program that grows through demonstrated value.

**Audience Interaction:**

Table exercise (10 minutes): Each table picks one pain point from their organization and maps it through the ACKU framework. What would Learn look like? What data would they need? Who would be the pilot group? Have 2-3 tables share.

### Use Case Prioritization: Impact vs Feasibility Matrix (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

You're going to leave today with dozens of ideas. You cannot do them all. Prioritization is the strategy.

**Impact Assessment (score 1-5):**
- How many hours per week does this task consume?
- How many people are affected?
- What's the error rate or rework rate?
- What's the financial exposure if this goes wrong?
- How visible is this to leadership?

**Feasibility Assessment (score 1-5):**
- Is the data available and clean?
- Can we use existing tools, or do we need custom development?
- How complex is the regulatory/compliance landscape?
- Do we have internal expertise to support this?
- Can we pilot this in under 90 days?

Multiply the scores. Anything above 15 goes on your shortlist. Anything above 20 is your starting point.

**Common Manufacturing/Supply Chain Use Cases Ranked:**

Tier 1 (High impact, High feasibility):
- Document summarization and drafting (SOPs, batch records, regulatory submissions)
- Quality complaint trend analysis
- Meeting and communication automation
- Inventory optimization recommendations

Tier 2 (High impact, Moderate feasibility):
- Predictive quality analytics
- Supplier risk assessment
- Demand planning augmentation
- Automated deviation investigation support

Tier 3 (High impact, Lower feasibility, plan for later):
- Real-time process optimization
- Computer vision for inspection
- Digital twins
- Autonomous scheduling

**Story/Anecdote:**

When we did this exercise internally, the highest-scoring use case wasn't anything sexy. It was helping quality engineers write deviation investigations faster. They were spending 2-3 hours per investigation, and we had hundreds per month. An AI tool that could draft the investigation based on the data, with the engineer reviewing and editing, cut that to 30-45 minutes. The engineers loved it because it freed them up for actual root cause analysis instead of paperwork. That's the kind of win that builds momentum.

### Building the Business Case Executives Actually Approve (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Your CFO doesn't care about neural networks. Your CFO cares about three things: How much does this cost? What's the return? What's the risk?

**The One-Page Business Case Template:**

1. **The Problem** (2 sentences max): What pain point are we solving? Who feels it?

2. **The Proposed Solution** (3 sentences max): What will we build/deploy? Who will use it? How does it work in plain English?

3. **Investment Required:**
   - Technology costs (licensing, infrastructure)
   - People costs (training, potential new hires)
   - Implementation costs (consulting, change management)
   - Timeline to deployment

4. **Expected Return:**
   - Hours saved per week/month (converted to dollars)
   - Error reduction (converted to cost avoidance)
   - Revenue impact (if applicable)
   - Payback period

5. **Risks and Mitigation:**
   - What could go wrong?
   - How will we prevent it?
   - What's our exit strategy if it doesn't work?

6. **Governance:**
   - Who owns this?
   - How will we ensure compliance?
   - What approvals are needed?

**Data Points to Cite:**
- McKinsey: Companies that tie AI investments to specific business outcomes are 1.5x more likely to see positive ROI
- Bain: The average AI pilot costs $500K-$2M; the average failed pilot wastes 60% of that with no recoverable value
- Internal benchmark: Our first use case cost under $100K and generated over $500K in annual productivity gains

**Story/Anecdote:**

I learned to build business cases in quality, not AI. When I needed to justify a $2M quality system upgrade, I didn't lead with the technology. I led with the cost of non-compliance: audit findings, customer complaints, potential FDA warning letters. The same principle applies to AI. Don't sell the technology. Sell the problem you're solving and the cost of not solving it.

---

### Stakeholder Mapping: Who Needs to Be in the Room (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

The biggest mistake I see: the AI strategy is built by IT and presented to the business as a finished product. That's backwards.

**Your Core Team (must be involved from day one):**
- Business sponsor (VP or above, owns the P&L where AI will deploy)
- IT/Data leader (technical feasibility and infrastructure)
- Legal/Compliance (governance, risk, regulatory requirements)
- HR/Talent (workforce development, change management)
- Finance (budget, ROI tracking)
- Operations champion (someone from the floor who knows the real workflows)

**Your Extended Network:**
- Union representatives (if applicable, bring them in early, not after decisions are made)
- Quality/Regulatory (in manufacturing, this is non-negotiable)
- Procurement (if supply chain use cases are in scope)
- Internal communications (you'll need them for the rollout)

**The Three Conversations You Must Have:**

1. **With your CEO:** "Here's our 90-day plan with one specific use case, expected ROI, and governance guardrails. I need your visible sponsorship." CEOs don't need details. They need confidence that you have a plan and you've thought about risk.

2. **With your CFO:** "Here's the investment, here's the return, here's the payback period, and here's our exit ramp if it doesn't work." CFOs need numbers and an honest assessment of risk.

3. **With your CHRO:** "Here's how we're going to develop our people, not replace them. Here's the training plan. Here's how we'll measure adoption." This conversation is often skipped. Don't skip it.

**Audience Interaction:**

Individual exercise (5 minutes): Write down the names of the 6 core team members you'd need at your organization. If you can't name all 6, that tells you something about how ready your org is. Circle the ones you think will resist. Those are your first phone calls when you get back.

**Transition to Module 3:**

You now have a framework, a prioritized list of use cases, a business case template, and a stakeholder map. That's more than most AI strategies ever produce, and we did it in 90 minutes. But here's the thing: strategy without execution is just hope. In the next module, we're going to talk about what actually happens when you try to implement AI in a real organization with real people who have real reasons to be skeptical. This is where it gets hard. And this is where most programs fail. Let's take a break.

---

## MODULE 3: "Implementation That Sticks" (90 minutes)

### Opening: The Pilot Trap (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Here's a number that should scare you: 80% of AI pilots never scale to production. Eighty percent.

That means four out of five times an organization says "Let's try AI," they try it, it kind of works, and then... nothing. The pilot runs for 6 months, the champion moves to another role, the budget gets reallocated, and the whole thing quietly dies.

Why? Because pilots are designed to prove technology works. But nobody asks the harder question: Can the organization absorb this into how it actually operates?

The Pilot Trap has three components:

**1. Success theater:** The pilot "works" in a controlled environment with enthusiastic volunteers and a dedicated support team. Nobody tests whether it works when the support team goes away.

**2. Scale blindness:** Going from 20 users to 2,000 users isn't 100x the same thing. It's a fundamentally different problem. Training, support, infrastructure, governance, all of it changes.

**3. Champion dependency:** The pilot works because Sarah in Plant 3 is passionate about it and manually solves every problem. When Sarah gets promoted, the pilot dies.

**Data Points to Cite:**
- Gartner: 53% of AI projects don't make it from prototype to production
- McKinsey: The primary barriers to scaling AI are organizational, not technical
- Deloitte: Companies that plan for scale from day one of the pilot are 2x more likely to achieve production deployment

**Story/Anecdote:**

I fell into this trap early. We built a great tool, piloted it with a small team, everyone loved it. Then we tried to roll it out company-wide and hit a wall. Different plants had different systems. Different teams had different workflows. The training that worked for 20 people didn't work for 200. We basically had to start over with a scale-first mindset. That six months of rework taught me a lesson I've never forgotten: design for 1,000 users on day one, even if you're starting with 10.

---

### Change Management Is 80% of the Work (20 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

I'm going to say something that will make every technologist in the room uncomfortable: the technology is the easy part.

Building an AI model? Getting an API connected? Deploying a tool? That's 20% of the work. The other 80% is getting people to actually use it. And not just use it once because their boss told them to. Use it every day because it makes their job better.

**The Three Fears:**

1. **Fear of replacement:** "Is this going to take my job?" This is the first question everyone asks, even if they don't ask it out loud. You need to address this directly, repeatedly, and honestly. In manufacturing, the answer is almost always: "No, this is going to take the boring parts of your job so you can focus on the parts that require your expertise."

2. **Fear of incompetence:** "I'm not a tech person. I won't be able to use this." People who have been experts in their field for 20 years don't want to feel like beginners. Your training approach matters enormously. Meet people where they are.

3. **Fear of accountability:** "If the AI gives me a wrong answer and I act on it, who's responsible?" This is especially acute in regulated industries. You need clear policies before you deploy, not after.

**The Adoption Curve:**

- 10-15% will adopt immediately (your champions, find them and empower them)
- 60-70% will adopt when they see colleagues succeeding (the majority, they need social proof)
- 15-20% will resist until it's the default way of working (don't fight them, just keep building momentum)
- 5% will never adopt (that's fine, don't optimize for them)

**Practical Change Management Tactics:**

1. **Executive sponsorship that's visible:** Not a one-time email. Regular check-ins, public recognition of early adopters, resources allocated visibly.

2. **Peer champions, not IT trainers:** The best person to teach a quality engineer about AI is another quality engineer who uses it, not someone from the data science team.

3. **Training that respects time:** Nobody wants a 4-hour workshop. Give them 30 minutes to get started, then office hours for questions. Repeat.

4. **Quick wins first:** Get people a tool that saves them 30 minutes THIS WEEK. Then talk about the bigger vision.

5. **Feedback loops that matter:** Ask people what's not working. Then fix it visibly. Nothing kills adoption faster than "We hear your feedback" followed by nothing changing.

**Story/Anecdote:**

The turning point in our AI program wasn't a technology breakthrough. It was a quality engineer named, let's call her Maria. Maria had been doing the same job for 15 years. She was skeptical of AI. Thought it was hype. But she agreed to try one tool: an AI assistant that helped her draft investigation reports. After a week, she told her team lead, "I just got two hours of my life back today." Her team lead told her director. The director told me. Within a month, Maria's entire department was using the tool. Within six months, she was training other departments. Maria sold our AI program better than any executive presentation ever could. Because she was credible. She was one of them.

**Audience Interaction:**

Table discussion (5 minutes): "Think of the last time your organization tried to deploy a new technology or process. What killed adoption? What worked?" Have tables share their top insight. Use this to validate the principles above.

---

### Building Internal Capability vs Outsourcing Everything (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

There's a hiring reflex in AI. "We need AI talent, let's go hire data scientists." Stop.

Here's why that's usually wrong for manufacturing and supply chain:

**The Knowledge Gap Problem:**
A data scientist with a Stanford PhD can build a beautiful model. But do they know what a batch record is? Do they understand GMP? Can they explain to a plant manager why the model's recommendation is worth trusting? Usually no. And that knowledge gap takes years to close.

Meanwhile, you have quality engineers, production planners, supply chain analysts who know your business inside and out. Teaching them to use AI tools takes weeks, not years.

**The Capability Model:**

Tier 1: AI Users (80% of your workforce, eventually)
- Use AI tools built for them
- Understand basic concepts (what AI can and can't do)
- Know how to evaluate AI outputs critically
- Training: 4-8 hours, ongoing support

Tier 2: AI Power Users (15% of your workforce)
- Customize AI tools for their function
- Build simple automations and workflows
- Train and support Tier 1 users
- Training: 20-40 hours, hands-on workshops

Tier 3: AI Builders (5% of your workforce)
- Develop and maintain AI solutions
- Integrate AI with existing systems
- Evaluate and select AI vendors and tools
- Training: Formal programs, certifications, continuous learning

**What to Outsource:**
- Infrastructure and platform management (cloud, security)
- Specialized model development (computer vision, NLP for specific applications)
- Initial architecture and design (then transfer knowledge internally)

**What to Keep In-House:**
- Use case identification and prioritization
- Change management and training
- Governance and compliance
- Day-to-day support and iteration
- The relationship between AI tools and business processes

**Data Points to Cite:**
- World Economic Forum: 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025
- LinkedIn: AI-related skills are the fastest-growing skills on the platform
- Accenture: Every $1 invested in AI workforce training returns $3.50 in productivity gains

**Story/Anecdote:**

We didn't hire a single data scientist for our AI adoption program. Not one. We took quality engineers, supply chain planners, marketing analysts, and taught them how to use AI tools effectively. We gave them sandbox environments to experiment. We paired them with technical mentors. Within a year, we had over 1,000 people who could use AI tools in their daily work. Some of them became power users who built solutions for their teams. That's sustainable. Hiring 20 data scientists who leave for a startup 18 months later is not.

---

### Measuring What Matters (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Most organizations measure AI the wrong way. They measure model accuracy. "Our predictive model is 94% accurate!" Great. Nobody's using it, but the model is very accurate.

**What NOT to measure (or at least, not primarily):**
- Model accuracy in isolation
- Number of AI projects initiated
- Amount spent on AI
- Number of data scientists hired

**What TO measure:**

**Adoption Metrics (are people using it?):**
- Daily/weekly active users
- Frequency of use per user
- Feature utilization (which capabilities are actually being used)
- Voluntary adoption rate (users who start without being told to)

**Efficiency Metrics (is it saving time?):**
- Hours saved per user per week
- Reduction in task completion time
- Reduction in rework or error rates
- Process cycle time improvement

**Business Impact Metrics (is it moving the needle?):**
- Cost savings (labor, materials, rework)
- Revenue impact (faster decisions, better forecasting)
- Quality improvement (fewer deviations, complaints, audit findings)
- Working capital impact (inventory reduction, cash flow improvement)

**Trust Metrics (do people trust it?):**
- User satisfaction scores
- Override rate (how often do people reject AI recommendations?)
- Escalation frequency (how often do problems require human intervention?)
- Net Promoter Score for AI tools (would you recommend this to a colleague?)

**The Reporting Cadence:**
- Weekly: Adoption dashboards (simple, automated)
- Monthly: Business impact review (cross-functional leadership)
- Quarterly: Strategy review and roadmap adjustment (executive steering committee)

**Story/Anecdote:**

The metric that changed everything for us was voluntary adoption rate. We stopped tracking how many people we trained and started tracking how many people used the tool the week AFTER training without being reminded. That number told us everything. If it was below 40%, we had a product problem, not a training problem. The tool wasn't good enough. If it was above 60%, we had a winner and needed to scale. That one metric saved us from investing in tools that looked good in demos but died in practice.

### Case Study: From 0 to 1,000+ AI Users in 18 Months (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Let me walk you through how we actually did this. Not theory. What happened.

**Month 0-3: Learn**
- Assessed current state: almost no AI adoption outside of the data science team
- Interviewed 40+ stakeholders across manufacturing, quality, supply chain, marketing
- Identified top pain points: document creation, data analysis, repetitive reporting
- Built the core team: myself, an IT partner, Legal, HR, and two operations champions
- Established governance framework before touching a single tool

**Month 3-6: First Use Case**
- Selected document summarization and drafting as first use case
- Piloted with 25 quality engineers across 2 plants
- Trained in 30-minute sessions, one-on-one follow-ups
- Measured: adoption, time saved, user satisfaction
- Results: 65% voluntary adoption after first week, average 4 hours saved per user per week

**Month 6-9: Expand**
- Used pilot data to build the business case for broader rollout
- Expanded to 5 more functions: supply chain planning, regulatory, R&D, marketing, engineering
- Trained peer champions in each function (2-3 per team)
- Established monthly "AI Office Hours" for questions and troubleshooting
- Added three more use cases based on user demand, not our roadmap

**Month 9-12: Scale**
- Rolled out to all NA manufacturing sites
- Formalized training program: onboarding module for new hires, quarterly refresh for existing users
- Created AI governance council with Legal, Compliance, IT, and Business representation
- Published AI use policy and guidelines
- Hit 500 active users

**Month 12-18: Sustain and Grow**
- Organic growth took over: people heard from colleagues and signed up voluntarily
- Exceeded 1,000 engaged users
- Launched internal AI community of practice
- Started measuring business impact systematically
- Identified next wave of use cases (predictive quality, demand planning)

**Key Lessons:**
1. Start boring. Document drafting isn't exciting, but it touches everyone.
2. Governance first. We never had a compliance incident because Legal was at the table from day one.
3. Champions over mandates. We never mandated adoption. We made the tools good enough that people chose to adopt.
4. Measure adoption, not just accuracy. A tool nobody uses is a failed tool, regardless of how accurate it is.
5. Budget for change management. We spent more on training and support than on technology. That was the right call.

**Audience Interaction:**

Open Q&A (5 minutes): "Based on what you've heard, what's the biggest obstacle you see in your organization?" Take 3-4 questions and tie answers back to the framework.

**Transition to Module 4:**

Everything we've covered so far, maturity assessment, strategy, implementation, it all depends on one thing: trust. Your employees need to trust the tools. Your customers need to trust your processes. Your regulators need to trust your controls. And trust doesn't happen by accident. It's built through governance. That's our final module, and I'd argue it's the most important one. Governance isn't the thing that slows you down. It's the thing that lets you go fast without breaking things. Let's take a short break.

## MODULE 4: "Governance First" (60 minutes)

### Opening: Why Governance Before Scale (10 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

I'm going to say something that might sound backwards: the very first thing we built in our AI program wasn't a tool. It was a governance framework.

Before we deployed anything, before we trained anyone, we brought Legal, Compliance, Privacy, and IT Security into a room and said: "We're going to start using AI across this organization. Help us do it right."

Most companies do the opposite. They build, deploy, scale, and THEN try to bolt governance on after something goes wrong. A data breach. A compliance violation. A model that produces biased results. An employee who feeds confidential data into a public AI tool.

By then, you've lost trust. And trust, once lost, takes years to rebuild.

**Data Points to Cite:**
- IBM: 74% of organizations are not taking adequate steps to ensure AI trustworthiness
- KPMG: 61% of executives are concerned about AI-related risks but only 17% have comprehensive governance programs
- EU AI Act: Regulation is coming whether you're ready or not; companies with governance frameworks will adapt faster

**Story/Anecdote:**

I come from a quality background. FDA-regulated manufacturing. In that world, you don't ship product and then figure out quality controls. You build quality into the process from the start. Every batch has documentation. Every deviation has an investigation. Every change has a review. The same principle applies to AI. Governance isn't bureaucracy. It's the quality system for your AI program. And in regulated industries, it's not optional.

When I brought Legal in on day one, they weren't obstacles. They were relieved. They said, "Thank you for including us before this became a problem." Legal and Compliance are only blockers when you surprise them. Include them early, and they become your strongest allies.

### Bringing Legal and Compliance in as Partners (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

The relationship between AI programs and Legal/Compliance teams is almost always adversarial. It doesn't have to be.

**Why it goes wrong:**
- AI team builds something, then asks Legal to approve it
- Legal doesn't understand the technology and defaults to "no"
- AI team gets frustrated, either goes around Legal or gives up
- Eventually something goes wrong, and Legal says "I told you so"
- Trust is destroyed

**How to fix it:**

**Step 1: Educate together**
Don't just brief Legal on your AI plans. Invite them to the same training sessions your business users attend. When Legal understands what AI can and can't do, they make better risk assessments.

**Step 2: Co-create the framework**
Ask Legal and Compliance to help design the governance structure, not review it after you've built it. Their input makes the framework stronger AND gives them ownership.

**Step 3: Define risk tiers together**
Not all AI use cases carry the same risk. A tool that summarizes meeting notes is not the same as a tool that recommends product formulations. Create risk tiers together:

- **Tier 1 (Low Risk):** Internal productivity tools, no customer data, no regulated decisions
  - Approval: Department manager
  - Review: Annual

- **Tier 2 (Medium Risk):** Tools that touch customer data, influence business decisions, or generate external-facing content
  - Approval: AI Governance Council
  - Review: Quarterly

- **Tier 3 (High Risk):** Tools that affect product quality, regulatory compliance, or safety
  - Approval: AI Governance Council + Legal + Quality
  - Review: Monthly, plus event-driven

**Step 4: Make compliance easy**
If your approval process takes 6 weeks, people will go around it. Create a fast track for Tier 1 use cases (48-hour approval) and a thorough but efficient process for Tier 2-3 (2-week maximum).

**Story/Anecdote:**

Our Chief Compliance Officer became one of our AI program's biggest advocates. Not because she loved technology, but because she saw that we were doing it responsibly. When other departments started AI initiatives without governance, she'd say, "Go talk to Chris's team. They know how to do this right." That endorsement was more valuable than any technology investment.

**Audience Interaction:**

Quick poll: "How would you describe your Legal/Compliance team's current relationship with AI initiatives?" Options: Supportive, Neutral, Skeptical, Adversarial, Not Involved. Discuss results.

### AI Risk Framework (15 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Let's get specific about what can go wrong and how to prevent it.

**Risk Category 1: Data Privacy and Security**
- Employees putting confidential data into public AI tools
- Customer data being used to train models without consent
- Data breaches through AI system vulnerabilities
- Cross-border data transfer issues

Prevention: Clear data classification policy, approved tool list, technical controls (DLP), regular audits

**Risk Category 2: Accuracy and Reliability**
- AI generating incorrect information (hallucinations)
- Models degrading over time (data drift)
- Over-reliance on AI without human verification
- Inconsistent outputs across users

Prevention: Human-in-the-loop requirements for high-risk decisions, regular model monitoring, clear policies on when AI output requires expert review

**Risk Category 3: Bias and Fairness**
- AI models reflecting historical biases in training data
- Discriminatory outcomes in hiring, pricing, or service delivery
- Lack of diversity in AI development teams leading to blind spots

Prevention: Bias testing before deployment, diverse review panels, regular fairness audits

**Risk Category 4: Regulatory and Compliance**
- AI-generated documents that don't meet regulatory standards
- Audit trail gaps (who made the decision, the human or the AI?)
- Intellectual property issues (AI-generated content ownership)
- Evolving regulations (EU AI Act, FDA guidance on AI in manufacturing)

Prevention: Clear documentation requirements, audit trail for AI-assisted decisions, regulatory monitoring, Legal review of AI outputs in regulated processes

**Risk Category 5: Organizational**
- Key person dependency (program dies when champion leaves)
- Vendor lock-in (single provider for critical AI capabilities)
- Shadow AI (unauthorized tool use)
- Change fatigue (too many new tools too fast)

Prevention: Distributed ownership, multi-vendor strategy, discovery audits for shadow AI, phased rollout

**Data Points to Cite:**
- Gartner: By 2026, organizations that operationalize AI transparency will see 40% improvement in AI adoption
- MIT: 78% of companies have experienced at least one AI failure, most related to data quality or governance gaps
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: Provides structure for identifying and managing AI risks

### Policy Templates and Governance Charter (10 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

I'm going to give you the building blocks of a governance framework. These aren't final policies; they're starting points you can customize.

**Document 1: AI Acceptable Use Policy**
Covers:
- What AI tools are approved for use
- What data can and cannot be used with AI tools
- Required human review for AI-generated outputs
- Reporting requirements for AI incidents
- Consequences for policy violations

Key principle: Make it short enough that people read it. One page. Two maximum.

**Document 2: AI Governance Charter**
Covers:
- AI Governance Council membership and responsibilities
- Decision-making authority (who approves what)
- Risk tier definitions and review processes
- Escalation procedures
- Meeting cadence and reporting requirements

Key principle: This is a living document. Review and update quarterly.

**Document 3: AI Use Case Approval Template**
For each new AI use case, document:
- Business problem and proposed solution
- Data requirements and classification
- Risk tier assessment
- Privacy impact assessment
- Compliance review
- Approval signatures
- Success metrics and review schedule

Key principle: Make it proportional. Tier 1 should be a one-page form. Tier 3 should be thorough.

**Document 4: AI Incident Response Plan**
What to do when:
- AI produces harmful or incorrect output
- Data breach through AI system
- Bias or discrimination is identified
- Regulatory inquiry about AI use

Key principle: Have this BEFORE you need it. Like a fire drill, not a fire.

**Audience Interaction:**

Give participants 5 minutes to draft the first three bullet points of their AI Acceptable Use Policy. What are the three most important rules for their organization? Share examples.

### The Trust Equation (10 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

I want to close with something that ties everything together. AI adoption, at its core, is a trust problem. And trust has a formula:

**Trust = (Transparency + Consistency + Competence) / Self-Interest**

**Transparency:** People need to understand what AI is doing and why. Not the mathematics. The reasoning. "This tool recommended reducing our safety stock by 15% because demand variability has decreased over the last 6 months." That's transparent. "The model says reduce stock" is not.

**Consistency:** The tools need to work the same way every time. If the AI gives different answers to the same question on different days, trust evaporates. This is a product quality issue, not an AI issue.

**Competence:** The tools need to be good enough. If AI gives wrong answers 20% of the time, people will stop trusting it even when it's right. Get the baseline quality right before you scale.

**Self-Interest (the denominator):** If people believe the AI program exists to cut headcount, trust is zero regardless of everything else. Be honest about the purpose: augmentation, not replacement. And then prove it through actions, not just words.

**Story/Anecdote:**

The moment I knew our program had earned trust was when a plant manager, someone who had been skeptical from the start, called me and said, "My team is asking for more AI tools. What else do you have?" He didn't call because I asked him to. He called because his team experienced the value and wanted more. That's trust. You can't mandate it. You can't rush it. You build it through transparency, consistency, competence, and genuine care for the people using the tools.

---

### Closing (5 minutes)

**Key Talking Points:**

Let me leave you with this:

AI in manufacturing and supply chain isn't about replacing your workforce. It's about amplifying the expertise that already exists in your organization. The quality engineer who's been doing investigations for 15 years doesn't need to be replaced by AI. She needs AI to handle the paperwork so she can spend more time on the analysis that only she can do.

The path forward isn't complicated, but it is hard. It requires honesty about where you are. Discipline in how you plan. Patience in how you implement. And governance that builds trust rather than fear.

You have everything you need to start. A maturity assessment. A strategy framework. An implementation playbook. A governance toolkit. The question isn't whether AI will transform manufacturing. It will. The question is whether you'll lead that transformation or react to it.

Go start with one use case. One quick win. One group of champions. Build from there.

Thank you.

**Final Audience Interaction:**

Each participant writes down their one action item: "When I get back to the office on Monday, I will ___________." Share with a partner. This creates accountability and makes the session actionable, not just informational.
